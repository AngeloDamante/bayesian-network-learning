# Project
The goal of this project is to build a bayesian network.
## Introduction
The dataset is generated by Hugin Lite software and network analyzed is "Asia" by bnlearn.com. 
Learning is done by applying a score-based model to the dataset. The model used is "Cooper & Herskovits" formula with likelihood function.
